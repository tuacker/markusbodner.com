### About
{{<figure src="/media/images/me.png" class="about-figure" alt="Markus Bodner" title="Markus Bodner" >}}
I'm Markus Bodner, and I'm a developer from Tirol, Austria.

I've previously made a neat little game named [Itror](https://itror.com).

You may also know me as **tuacker** and read my thoughts on <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tuacker). I also love playing games, mostly via <i class="fa fa-steam"></i> [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tuacker/), with my current most played game being [Dota 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/).
