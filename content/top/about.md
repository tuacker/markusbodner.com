### About

I'm Markus Bodner, and I'm a game developer in Tirol, Austria.

I am currently working on my first game called [In The Right Order](http://www.magnetforge.com/intherightorder) the developement process of which I'll be sharing here.

You may also know me as **tuacker** and read my thoughts and amazing jokes on <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tuacker). I also love playing games, mostly via <i class="fa fa-steam"></i> [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tuacker/), with my current most played game being [Dota 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/).
