# About
{{<figure src="/media/images/me.jpg" class="about-figure" alt="Markus Bodner" title="Markus Bodner" >}}
I'm Markus Bodner, and I'm a developer from Tirol, Austria.

I'm currently working on [Bold Shows](https://boldshows.com) a site to track TV shows. Never miss an episode ever again.

You may also know me as **tuacker** and read my thoughts on <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tuacker). I also love playing games, mostly via <i class="fa fa-steam"></i> [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tuacker/), with my current most played game being [Dota 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/).

The RSS feed for this site is located <i class="fa fa-rss"></i> [here](/index.xml), or if you prefer you can subscribe via e-mail at the bottom of the page.

You're welcome to email me about anything. <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> [me@markusbodner.com](mailto:me@markusbodner.com)
