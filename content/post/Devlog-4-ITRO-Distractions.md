This weeks devlog arrives a bit later than usual. In the [last devlog](https://markusbodner.com/2015/07/07/devlog-3---itro-eye-candy-it/) I mentioned I wanted to focus on the missing settings and game over screens. That didn't happen.

Let's have a look at what changed with Itro, the game about selecting pictograms the order they originally appeared with each round adding a new one, instead.

As the title indicates I got distracted this week. Both with the game and other stuff. I spent a lot of time trying out different animations when the player taps a pictogram. How it should animate a selected state. How it should disappear if the guess was correct and so on.

None of which will see the light of day. There is only a very minor change to the previous week and a 'wrong guess' visual feedback is still missing.

Once I figured that this wasn't the week to get this right I started working on finishing the gameplay UI by adding hearts, a visual separator between pictograms and score as well as the time-bar. Plus Bombs! Which don't go boom yet, but you shouldn't be touching these anyways ;).

Have a look how the game looks right now:

The game is quite hard with Time Attack and Bombs modifier active, as shown above. Coincidentially last week was also the first time I actually managed to beat my own game. Took my brain long enough to figure this out.

Allright, let's try this again: I plan on spending the next week on implementing all missing UI/settings scenes.

As always feel free to contact me if you have any questions. You can find my mail at the top and bottom of the page.
