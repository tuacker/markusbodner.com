It is said that shipping is the hardest part, but starting out can be just as daunting. I've been playing with the idea of starting my own company for years.

With some money in my banking account I finally took the jump in 2014. While legally the name of the company is my name, Markus Bodner, I'm collecting and publishing all the apps and games under the moniker [magnetforge](https://magnetforge.com).

Head over there [now](https://magnetforge.com) and check out what I've got in store for you.

I'll use this blog for developement updates of new projects as well as boring you with personal opinions on topics I probably shouldn't be writing about. You should also follow me on Twitter [@tuacker](https://www.twitter.com/tuacker).
