If you've just upgraded to Windows 10 you might find that your games are suddenly feeling sluggish or slower than usual. The reason for this is the integrated XBOX DVR functionality.

#### How to disable DVR

- Open the XBOX app
- Go to Settings
- Disable DVR for Games


#### What is it?
The DVR allows you to capture the past few seconds of your gameplay and share it with the world. This is great if you just did something awesome ingame because DVR is always recording.

Not so great though for your framerate. If you don't need the recording functionality and want more than 60FPS simply disable it.

While a 60FPS cap might be manageable the DVR functionality also tends to create input lag which is an absolute no. 

Personally I think this feature should be opt-out instead of the opt-in as it is now.
