+++

Last week's [devlog](https://www.markusbodner.com/2015/07/01/devlog-2---itro-modifying-for-a-harder-game/) was about getting the core of Itro running. If you don't know, Itro is a game about selecting pictograms the order they originally appeared with each round adding a new one.

This of course requires actual images and not just numbers as it was until now. So I spend the week to update the eye candy of the game.

There's still a lot left to do. There's no menu styling yet. The game over screen is barren and not all animations and transitions are done. Yet it is all slowly coming together, check it out yourself.

I'll probably spend the next week on implementing the missing pause, settings and game over screens as well as styling them all up.

If you have any questions or just wan't to chat, don't hesitate to email me.
