It's been a while since my last [Devlog](https://www.markusbodner.com/2015/07/18/devlog-4---itro-distractions/) and quite a bit changed. Including the name from Itro to **Itror**. ROAR!

If you don't know Itror is a game challenging your memory. You have to select icons in the order they appeared with each round adding a new one.

While I fixed some minor gameplay related issues here and there the last 2 weeks were mostly spent on the pause and game over screens. You're can now enable/disable the modifiers I've mentioned in an earlier devlog from there.

Having all 3 of them active at the same time makes the game very, very difficult I've found.

And I've learned I really don't like making menus. Itror launches directly into gameplay, no main menu. So I skipped that part but the pause/game over screens I had to make.

It's all slowly coming together and I'll probably do sound next.

Don't expect anything next week as I won't be home half of the time. It's Dota 2 The International 2015 final time!

As always if you have any questions feel free to drop me a mail.
