A little less than a week ago on Tuesday, October 3rd I finally released the first version of [Claire Budget](https://budgetwithclaire.com). Looking back at the first [devlog]({{< ref "post/budget-with-claire.md" >}}) I set out some goals. Let's take a look how that worked out.<!--more-->

With only two sales so far not very good. This doesn't feel great to say the least. After several months of work that is all after one week of sales. At the same time it isn't very surprising. While I don't state it in the first devlog, the reason behind wanting to write tips is to get the word out about Claire Budget. I didn't do any of that. As a result no one knows about my app.

The few sales I got I attribute to my post on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/claire-budget). At first it looked like I'm not getting a single upvote. After a few hours they began tickling in. Currently sitting at 45 upvotes it is not a lot compared to others, but it got at least something done.

So for the next few weeks instead of coding in silence, I'll spend a lot of time getting the word out. I've should have done marketing a long time ago, but it is not something I enjoy a lot. This has to change.

#### Stats - Week 1
**Sales:** <5  
**Revenue:** ~$10  
**Sites contacted:** 1  

This week I will contact as many blogs and sites writing about personal finance / budgeting as I can find.
