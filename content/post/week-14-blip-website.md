I don't think I have "blanked" on making a website as much as I did for Blip this past week. I am getting somewhere now though.<!--more-->

Aside from trying to get CSS right, making websites has always been enjoyable to me. For past projects I managed to get basic concepts going rather quick. This week though for Blip I've been drawing blanks after blanks. Monday and Tuesday I barely managed to get the HTML boilerplate going. I was not "seeing" the page at all.

Slowly over the course of the week I did get one thing going, then another and I now have something I quite like. There is still some work to do, the copy is bad and I want to add a quick video that shows off Blip in action.

I've also spent a minute researching how to do licensing as mentioned [last weeek]({{< relref "week-13-blip-iconic.md" >}}) and settled on using whatever [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com) provides as part of their service. Not quite sure how much their SDK talks home (privacy issue), but that is something for another time.

For the upcoming week I am hoping for one that is suuuuuper productive compared to the past few ones. I want:

- the website done
- buy the domain
- set up app updating
- set up notarization
- begin working on payment

That's a lot planned, I know, but should also be doable?!

I didn't think about / buy a domain yet so I can't link to the site at this moment but here is a picture. Again, the copy is not final:

The next two sections try to explain how to use Blip and its use cases. The last section is a note from myself mentioning how I use blip and what future plans for it might be](/images/blip/2021-05-08-website-full.png)
