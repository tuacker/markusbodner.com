Flexing my artistic skills this week to make a nice app and status-bar icon for Blip and more.<!--more-->

I'm not the best with regards to designing logos etc. I do have some cool ideas in my head I like to think, but getting them on paper, so to say, is always a bit of a struggle. I do enjoy this type of work though and can get lost moving things up and down one pixel at a time.

First thing of the week some sketching in my notebook:

I was looking at other icon designs while making these sketches. Trying to come up with something I like. After a bit I decided to boot up Sketch and see what I can actually achieve. And it went a whole different direction from there. Ending up with this suuuuuuuuper shiny button thingie:

![a round, very shiny, blue-ish button with a plus sign engraved on it with a purple background making up an app icon](/images/blip/2021-04-27-first-app-icon-version.png)

I did like that. For a night. When I woke up the next morning I quickly lost my liking for it and went back to sketching a bit more. I was attempting to make something that looks like the letter "B" with these sketches:

After doing that for a bit I once again returned to Sketch to see what I can get done there. To my surprise a very short amount of time later I ended up with something I still like a few days later. I consider this the now final version of the Blip app icon.

Looks kinda good, right? If you squint you can read it as "Blip". I quite like it. From there it was easy to also design a status-bar icon. Which looks the same as the first hump in the main icon that represents the "B".

With these two big things designed and done I spent the next part of the week refactoring code a bit. Finding better ways to define colors and assets, etc. I've also spent some time to write up the Credits/About for Blip and including Acknowledgments for open source libraries and resources used to make Blip. Namely [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift), [KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts), [LaunchAtLogin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin), and [NetNewsWire](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire) which I use to learn a thing or two.

Admittedly everything after making the icons was a bit of distraction work. Still very important things, but I intended to do something else this week: Begin work on the website. Even right now as I am writing this I am procrastinating from that work.

I'm in this weird place at the moment where 3 things depend on each other and all I can do is slowly work on each of these a little until the pieces fit. Website, Licensing and Payment are their names. I need a website to set up payments, payments require a website to test and licensing requires knowledge about payments etc.

With no clear vision of the website in mind and no idea how licensing/payment will work out I am dreading the work a little. This leads to more procrastinating. And then feeling bad that I am not doing anything. A hellish cycle into deeper and deeper depths.

That said, I am rather fond that I do realize that this is happening. Previously in my life I might not have caught myself this quick and the outcomes of that are...bad. So! Here are the plans for week 14:

- Make the website
- Buy domain name
- Figure out how to make license keys
- Maybe begin work on payments
