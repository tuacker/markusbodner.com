Almost 4 years ago I started this blog to share my journey and opinions. But aside from a few technical posts that didn't happen. Until recently I wasn't really aware why that is, why it is so hard for me to share my ideas. Now I think I can take steps to improve.<!--more-->

Growing up I've always been a bit more forward looking than my more traditional surroundings. As such my opinions were often shut down quick and sometimes harsh. Combined with my introversion this caused me become a silent party. I'd only say something when I was addressed directly and even then keep it short, with the occasional funny quip.

As a quiet listener you also tend to get a better feeling for what is going on with the people around you, and how their interactions affect each other. I've noticed how the opinion of certain people could affect the opinion of a whole group. A group could take on an idea which on an individual level would never be considered or is mis-aligned with their morality even.

The combination of both: my opinions not being valued, and realising the power your thoughts could have over others that look up to you, made me very cautious about sharing my ideas.

**So cautious in fact that it became crippling and I didn't share my viewpoints at all.**

I am now trying to break out of this overzealous self-censorship. The goal is to remain aware of how it may affect others, while trying to venture into the unknown. If at some point I don't get something terribly wrong I haven't gone outside my comfort zone enough.

I like to think that I'll be able to re-align my world view if I do get called out on something stupid I say. I consider those valuable moments where I can uncover something new about myself and others. Gonna be interesting!
