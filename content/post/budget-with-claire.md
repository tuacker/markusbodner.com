If you follow me on twitter you might have noticed I [retweeted](https://twitter.com/ClaireBudget/status/864404862158725120) something earlier today. That is because I have stared a new project called [Budget With Claire](https://budgetwithclaire.com).<!--more-->

So what is Budget With Claire? Well right now, nothing but a name and website. Soon it'll be an app here to help you keep a healthy budget.

If you are thinking 'there are already a few budgeting apps on the app store' you are right. I've had a look at them and thought it could be done better. One of the main pain points was first-use experience.

All existing personal finance apps just throw you into the deep end, hoping you can figure out how to use them by yourself. My goal is to provide a simple, beautiful and easy to use alternative. One that guides you, helps you to create a budget you are happy with, and set goals.

In addition to that I also plan on writing helpful tips & tricks on how to manage your personal finance at the [Budget With Claire Blog](https://budgetwithclaire.com/blog/). So even if you don't need an app, reading the blog might be helpful on its own.

This is the vision I have for Budget With Claire. I'll keep writing devlog posts here, so make sure to sign-up for the newsletter if that interests you. If you only care about updates head over to the [website](https://budgetwithclaire.com) and sign-up for the newsletter there or follow the [twitter account](https://twitter.com/clairebudget).
