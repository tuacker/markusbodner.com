      <h2>Once FYI</h2>
      <span class="project__tech">Elixir, Phoenix Framework, Postgres, Mailgun, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>

    <p>A one time mailing list. Let people sign up, and once you're ready to announce your cool thing send <em>one</em> email to everyone on the list and the list self-destructs. Very useful for small announcements, followups multiple people are interested in, or to guarantee the other side they won't be spammed and only contacted about that one thing they signed up for.</p>
